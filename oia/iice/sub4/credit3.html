                                        Can I transfer credits for courses in majors not offered at UOS (e.g.,
                                        psychology) that I took at an overseas university?
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="a">
                                    <span>A1</span>
                                    <p>
                                        Yes, it is possible.
                                        Even for majors not offered at UOS, if you took major courses at an overseas university, they can be transferred as other department majors (i.e., general electives).
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <span>Q2</span>
                                    <p>I'm in the business administration department. There's a business major course offered in the business department of my exchange university that isn't offered in UOS's business department. Can I transfer the credits when I return?</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="a">
                                    <span>A2</span>
                                    <p>
                                        Yes, it is possible since UOS majors don't cover all detailed academic fields.
                                        However, since it's credit recognition for a major course, you should check with your department before finalizing course registration abroad, using forms like the application for permission to study at another university, to confirm if the course content aligns with UOS's major curriculum for later credit transfer.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                            <li>
                                <div class="q">
                                    <span>Q3</span>
                                    <p>Can I transfer credits for liberal arts courses not offered at UOS after taking them?</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="a">
                                    <span>A3</span>
                                    <p>
                                        Yes, it is possible since UOS's liberal arts curriculum doesn't cover all liberal arts.<br/>
                                        You should check in advance with the Department of Liberal Arts Education, similar to the major course confirmation process above.

                            <li>
                                <div class="q">
                                    <span>Q4</span>
                                    <p>I am studying abroad for 1 year. Should I transfer credits by semester or all at once for the whole year? </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="a">
                                    <span>A4</span>
                                    <p>
                                        You can process it all at once when you receive the full year transcript after returning. You could do it after each semester ends, but it may be difficult if you're not in Korea. (As explained in the credit transfer procedure above, credit transfer isn't completed just by submitting documents, but by visiting relevant offices with the documents.)
