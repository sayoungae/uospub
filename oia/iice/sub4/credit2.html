                                            However, experimental/practical courses or foreign language classes (to transfer as liberal arts electives) must clearly show class hours on syllabus (1 credit per 30 hours). If class hours cannot be confirmed on syllabus, must obtain separate documents like class schedule to confirm hours.

                                            As syllabus often cannot be obtained after returning to Korea, be sure to obtain syllabus while studying abroad.<br/>
