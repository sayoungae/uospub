                                Once you are admitted to the University of Seoul as an exchange student, the coordinators of the IICE office will contact you directly and assist you with your course registration. You may register a course or drop a course online during the course change period, the first week of each semester. Normally, course registration and changes are done through the website at http://wise.uos.ac.kr. Unfortunately, since all the instructions are in Korean, you are advised to ask for your UOS Buddy’s help.
