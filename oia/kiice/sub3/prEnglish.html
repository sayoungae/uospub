They will learn to understand how the architectural and urban space reflects activities, psychology, health, and culture. Students will explore topics including mental health; injury in housing; human development in education facilities; social capital, crime, and community in neighborhoods; stress and self-esteem in workplace and health and environment for the elderly. Team projects will be accompanied with lectures in which students will develop design projects with health related issues in mind. Team projects typically involve extended investigations on surroundings of a site and people for health improvement.

Drawing on data from a variety of big data sources, we will examine how popular research questions can be tackled by computerized research methods to supplement traditional ways of English linguistic analysis. We will focus on understanding basic linguistic concepts and how they are used in two main approaches to big data analysis, (i) Corpus-based analysis and (ii) Statistical analysis. We will learn how to use various methods to solve problem sets and conduct mini projects with one of the introduced analytics tools. <div class="head"><a href="javascript:popClose('spring_pop01793')" class="close"><img src="../../static/images/close.png" alt=""></a></div>

This particular section will focus on the theme “doing humor/comedy” in American and British culture, exploring various genres of comedy. The language focus of this course varies depending on the material seen in the selected films, but centers around understanding idiomatic language, expanding vocabulary, and recognizing dialectal differences in English – necessary components for understanding and doing humor in English. We explore these components through cultural discussions that will precede and follow film viewings. Students will improve their listening skills through film observation and assignments designed to test comprehension, while also reflecting on cultural similarities and differences. <div class="head"><a href="javascript:popClose('spring_pop27105')" class="close"><img src="../../static/images/close.png" alt=""></a></div>

This course starts with a brief review of Fourier transform, random process, filtering, and spectrum analysis for the analysis of analog communication systems. This course deals with analog modulation and detection of AM, FM, and PM. Under the additive noise channel, the noise effect on system performance will be analyzed. Also, other topics such as multiplexing, sampling theorem, and analog pulse coded modulation will be covered in this course. <div class="head"><a href="javascript:popClose('spring_pop35089')" class="close"><img src="../../static/images/close.png" alt=""></a></div>

It is imperative that organizations understand the key HRM functions and how these functions should be aligned in order to gain competitive advantage through their people. Human Resource Management issues begin to appear from the very moment you hire someone for the first time, or you are hired by someone for the first time. You will likely spend a major part of your life working for organizations as an employee ,or, perhaps, leading one you have started. Also, you could become an HR professional. In any case, however, your knowledge and understanding on human resource management will help you succeed in your career, as an employee, a top manager, a business owner, or an HR professional. This course will provide you with a systematic understanding of HRM We adopt the perspectives of both general and HR.<div class="head"><a href="javascript:popClose('fall_pop27407')" class="close"><img src="../../static/images/close.png" alt=""></a></div></div></div>
