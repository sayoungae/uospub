                                                        In the 21st century, not only fine arts but also practical design disciplines develop systematically.
                                                        In short, it goes beyond simple function and sensory realms, with human imagination and creativity interacting complexly with intellectual elements.
                                                        This becomes an important mutuality with interdisciplinary exchanges and connections with adjacent disciplines such as humanities, natural sciences, and engineering.
                                                        Based on this, this department aims to activate the convergence of academic systems based on modern sculpture and design majors, and to improve the creative cultural prosperity of fine arts and design as its educational goal.
