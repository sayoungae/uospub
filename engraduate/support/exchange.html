                                One of the key projects that the University of Seoul is focusing on to become an internationally open university for the new millennium is international exchange.
                                Starting with the University of Akron in the U.S. in 1986, we currently have academic exchange agreements with 65 universities in 22 countries, actively engaging in professor and student exchanges, academic material and information exchanges, staff exchanges, and academic conferences.
                                In 2001, we signed an academic exchange agreement with the National University of Mongolia, exchanging about 10 students annually, and also signed an academic exchange agreement with Moscow State University in the same year.
                                <br><br>
                                In 2004, we actively signed academic and student exchange agreements with prestigious universities in the U.S. and China, and since 2005, we have been working on exchange agreements at the department and faculty level.
                                We will continue to build cooperative relationships with universities in English-speaking countries and European regions in the future
                                Particularly in September 2006, we initiated a dual-degree program and signed student exchange agreements with San Francisco State University (SFSU) and the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook, contributing to the development of globally competitive talent among University of Seoul students.
                                <br><br>
                                In addition, we host international academic conferences such as the Seoul Metropolitan Fora (SMF), Seoul–Shanghai Forum, and East Asian Architectural Union, engaging in in-depth academic exchanges with prestigious universities in Taiwan, Hong Kong, U.S., China, Japan, and other countries across various academic fields.
